<h1> How to Play: </h1>
<h2> Get a password by subscribing to one of the OnlyFans accounts listed on the Home page. </h2>
<h2> Click one of the Bet buttons depending on how much you wish to stake. Both players start with $400. </h2>
<h2> You will be dealt 2 cards, and the stripper will be dealt 2 cards, with one visible to you. </h2>
<h2> If you get blackjack (total of 21), you will win 1.5 times your stake. </h2>
<h2> Cards are worth their face value. J, Q, K, are worth 10, and A is worth 11 or 1. </h2>
<h2> The goal is to get your hand as close to 21 as possible without going over. </h2>
<h2> Click hit to add another card to your hand. </h2>
<h2> If your hand goes over 21, you bust and lose your stake. </h2>
<h2> Click stand to end your turn </h2>
<h2> The stripper will then reveal her hidden card, and hit or stand. </h2>
<h2> If the stripper busts (goes over 21), you win her stake. </h2>
<h2> Whoever has the highest total otherwise wins this round. </h2>
<h2> If there is a tie, all bets are returned. </h2>
<h2> Each time you win $100, the stripper will take off one article of clothing! </h2>
<h2> Have fun! </h2>
